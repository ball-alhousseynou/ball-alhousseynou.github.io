<div style="text-align: justify">This project shows how to combine sentence transformers(SBERT) and elasticsearch to find similar papers. SBERT give the embedding(dense vectors) for each papers. ElasticSearch store the dense vectors and use them for document scoring. As corpus, we use all EMNLP publications from 2016 - 2018. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Based on information about cars, we predict the probability of crash. General description and data are available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/auto-insurance-fall-2017">Kaggle</a>. The dataset has a lot of features. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The aim of this challenge is to place six virtual ambulances around the city of Nairobi, moving them around throughout the day with the goal of minimising the distance travelled when responding to crashes during the test period. We submit a schedule of six ambulances every 3 hours. For each crash recorded, we find the distance between that crash and the nearest ambulance according to our schedule. </div>
